                    <h2>What are magnets?</h2>
                    <p><span class="bold">Magnets</span> are metals that attract other metals. Every magnet is a metal, but not all metals are magnets. They may
                    have practical uses, like keeping doors shut and moving heavy objects, but they can be really fun aswell.</p>

                    <h2>How magnets work</h2>
                    <p>Magnets have two ends. We call these their <span class="bold">north pole</span> and <span class="bold">south pole</span> .</p>
                    <p>When two of the same poles are placed close together they <span class="bold">repel</span> (push apart) each other. When two different poles are 
                    close, they <span class="bold">attract</span> (pull together) each other.</p>
                    <p>Magents only need to be near each other to attract and repel. They don't need to be touching. The space around a magnet has attrating and 
                        repelling forces. These are the strongest at the poles of the magnets.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/images/magnets2.png" class="top_img">
                    <p>Some magnets are stronger than others. Strong magnets will create bigger pushing and pulling forces than weaker magnets.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="section3">
                    <h2>What materials are magnetic?</h2>
                    <p>If a magnet sticks to a material, then that material is <span class="bold">magnetic.</span> This material will also be a metal.</p>
                    <p>There are four magnetic metals:</p>
                    <p>• Iron</p>
                    <p>• Nickel</p>
                    <p>• Cobalt</p>
                    <p>• Steel</p>
                    <img src="/images/magnetic_metals.png" class="top_img">
                    <p>Materials like plastic, cotton and stone are not magnetic because maganets do not stick to them.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="section4">
                    <h2>Non-magnetic metals</h2>
                    <p>Most other metals are not magnetic</p>
                    <p>Copper pipes that carry water around your house and aluminium foil in your kitchen are not attracted to magnets. Another two metals that are not 
                        attracted to magnets are gold and silver.</p>
                    <p>Magnets can be useful. We use them to keep fridge doors closed. But we would not want all metals to be magnetic - our knoves and forks 
                        would stick together when we eat.

                    <p>Two metals that are not magnetic are gold and silver. They are often used to make jewellery.</p>
